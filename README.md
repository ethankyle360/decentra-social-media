## Introduction

Decentra is a Web3-based decentralized application that showcases various aspects of decentralized web development. It provides insights into integrating blockchain technology, data querying with GraphQL, and building user interfaces using the Chakra UI framework. This application is designed as an educational project, aimed at helping developers grasp the fundamentals of Web3 DApp development.

## Features

- **Blockchain Integration:** Decentra integrates with a blockchain network to demonstrate how smart contracts and transactions can be used in a decentralized application.

- **Data Fetching:** GraphQL is utilized for efficient data fetching, enabling smooth interactions between the frontend and the backend of the application.

- **User Interface:** The Chakra UI framework is leveraged to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for the DApp.

## Technologies Used

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- GraphQL: A query language and runtime for APIs, providing an efficient and flexible approach to data fetching.
- Chakra UI: A UI component library that simplifies the process of building responsive and aesthetically pleasing interfaces.
- Ethereum (or your chosen blockchain network): Integration with blockchain technology for decentralized interactions.
- Lens: A Web3 Social Graph, on the Polygon PoS blockchain, empowers creators with a user-owned, composable social graph.
